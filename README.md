## 🚀 Usage

### Clone it
Since this repo contains high-res assets, it is heavy. I recommend a **shallow clone** to save time and disk space (skips the git history):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Brian-Zavala/favorite-wallpapers.git
cd favorite-wallpapers
```
### [**OR JUST DOWNLOAD ZIP FILE**](https://github.com/Brian-Zavala/favorite-wallpapers/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
